        <p class="author">By Tyler Kunce</p>
        <p class="text">In an extraordinary twist of fate, Grandma Edna found herself at the
            forefront of a potential crisis when her clever Wi-Fi security measures unexpectedly
            thwarted an alien invasion. As alien spacecraft descended upon the town, panic spread
            until Grandma Edna calmly intervened, resetting her router with a cryptic passphrase
            known only to her.

        <p class="text">The aliens, encountering unforeseen technological barriers, struggled to
            breach Grandma Edna's fortified network. Frustrated and bewildered, they eventually
            retreated to reassess their invasion strategy, leaving residents both relieved and
            amazed at Grandma Edna's resourcefulness.
