        <h1>Run Less, Run Faster</h1>
        <p>This webpage provides tools describing the 3 key runs as part of the Run Less, Run
             Faster approach to distance training.

            <h2>Track Intervals</h2>
            <p>Track Intervals, or Repeats, improve VO2 max, running speed, and running economy. As
                the name suggests, the intention is to repeat certain distances (intervals) with a
                target pace in mind.

            <h2>Tempo Run</h2>
            <p>Tempo Runs improve endurance by raising the lactate threshold. They typically are
                run over longer distances than track intervals at a slower pace than intervals,
                though still considered 'hard'.</p>

            <h2>Long Run</h2>
            <p>Long Runs improve endurance, in contrast to Tempo Runs, by raising aerobic
                metabolism. They tend to be longer mileage runs than Tempo Runs at a more 'pedestrian'
                pace, considered about 30 seconds per mile slower than goal race pace.
